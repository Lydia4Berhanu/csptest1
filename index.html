  <h1> My First Website</h1>
  <p> Hello World! This is my first website. Yay!
  <p> Here is another paragraph of text.
  <hr>
  <p> And here is another paragraph.
  Notice that spacing doesnt really matter.
  Everything is printed on one line on the page.
  Even though in the code, these are all seprate lines.
  <p> If you want a new line, you need to use another paragraph tag.
